# Javascript Aside: Functions and Strings
+ You can convert a function to its string representation by calling its toString()
+ Than do some fancy coding to figure out each part of the function
+ That's how angular does stuff

## The Code

```
var searchPeople = function(firstName, lastName, height, ago){
  return 'Jane Doe';
}

var searchPeopleString = searchPeople.toString();
//this will return a string
console.log(searchPeopleString);

```
