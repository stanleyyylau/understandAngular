# How Does Angular Do Dependency Injection?

+ When it see the $scope string, it will crate an object and pass it to the controller function
+ Even thought the $scope is not defined anywhere, it's just string.
+ When it gets passed to a function, things are different
+ Scope is a core service that is a part of the angular module
+ There are also other services as well


## Code

```
var searchPeople = function($scope, firstName, lastName, height, ago){
  return 'Jane Doe';
}



var searchPeopleString = searchPeople.toString();
//this will return a string
console.log(searchPeopleString);

console.log(angular.injector().annotate(searchPeople));

```
