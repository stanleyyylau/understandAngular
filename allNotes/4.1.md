# Scope and Interpolation
+ Whatever sitting in the scope, becomes avariblae inside the view
+ You don't need to type $scope.name
+ Whatever inside the scope gets connected to the view you specify

## Big Word
**Interpolation: Creating a string by combining strings and placeholders.**

'My name is' + name is interpolated, and results in 'My name is Tony'




## Code

```
myApp.controller('mainController', ['$scope', '$timeout', function($scope, $timeout) {

      $scope.name = 'Tony';
      //this is to prove it's two-way binding
      $timeout(function(){
          $scope.name = 'Everybody';
      },3000);

}]);

```
