# Getting Other Services
+ Don't write your own stuff, use their service
+ Or write your own service
+ That's how you write good code


## Module dependency injection
+ Use message module for form validation
+ Use resource module
+ The point is to show you the possibilities with modules and services
+ The video did not dig any deeper

## service
+ $log
+ $filter
+ angular-messages.js




 ```
 $log.log("Hello");
 $log.info("this is some information");
 $log.warn("warining!");
 $log.debug("some debug information");

 ```
