# Modules, Apps, and Controllers

+ Not polluting the global variable
+ We only gonna pollute global with one variable


## The Code

```
//angular.module first takes the module name
//than an array of dependencies
//We only have one variable in the global name space
//And that is an angular module


//this starts the MV* thing, it tells angular what view this app
//is gonna to control, you need to add HTML attribute
//In your HTML tag, put in ng-app="myApp"
//this binds everything in HTML tags to myApp variable
//It's now connected to that part of the DOM

//From now on, everything we add will be under the myApp variable
//And it does not pollute global name space
//And now myApp has all the functions that angular.module has

var myApp = angular.module('myApp', []);

//Next thing is to declare a controller


//controller function is avariable to you
//because myApp is now an Angular module

//controller takes the name of your controller and a callback function

//this is the controller for the view

//you can define a sub view inside your HTML
// ng-controller="mainController"

//Any code inside mainController will controll that HTML part
myApp.controller('mainController', function(){
 //the controller in here will be the model,
 //in the HTML is the view

});

```
