# Javascript Aside: Dependency Injection

## Dependency Injection
+ Fundamental
+ Need to understand this first

## Big Word
**Dependency Injection: Giving a function an object**

Rather than creating an object inside a function, you pass it to the function


## Example
```
var Person = function(firstname, lastname){
  this.firstname = firstname;
  this.lastname = lastname;
}

//this logPerson function is dependent on the variable john
//it's a dependency,it something were to change about John
//You will have to change it inside the LogPerson function
//And it's bad


function logPerson(){
  var john = new Person('John', 'Doe');
  console.log(john);
}

logPerson();

```


## What it's like to use dependency injection

+ Pass the object to the function instead of creating the object inside the function
+ This logPerson function is not dependent on how john is created
+ It's the key and the way Angular does dependency injection is really really cool

```
var Person = function(firstname, lastname){
  this.firstname = firstname;
  this.lastname = lastname;
}

function logPerson(person){
  console.log(person);
}

var john = new Person('John', 'Doe');
logPerson(john);

```
